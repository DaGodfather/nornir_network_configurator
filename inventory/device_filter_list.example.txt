# Device Filter List
# This file is used to filter which devices from hosts.yaml will be processed
# One device name per line (must match the device name in hosts.yaml)
# Lines starting with # are comments and will be ignored
# Empty lines are ignored

# Example devices:
edge1
core-sw1
dist-sw1

# You can comment out devices to exclude them:
# access-sw1

# To use this file in production:
# 1. Copy this file to device_filter_list.txt
# 2. Add your device names (one per line)
# 3. Run the script - it will only process devices listed here
# 4. Any devices not found in hosts.yaml will be reported at the end
